# 12/4/23 3:22pm Other then eval today I set up a very basic file structure. I am currently digging into the weather api docs on how to get the data I want.
# 12/5/23 3:37pm Worked on attempting to fetch data from API.
# 12/6/23 3:30pm Got all most of my fetches done. Working on five day and search bar next. Needs to add some styling.
# 12/7/23 3:38pm Added search functionality. Mild Styling to get objects to manipulate. Didn't get five day forecast done yet, will continue to work on after class.
# 12/8/23 3:35pm Got the five day to work. Started laying out the favorites, didn't get it done. Will finish the parts that didn't get done at a later point.

# Comments: Site looks good, favorites bar doesn't work but is still designed well, The weather icons change and are styled better then the figma icons. Search functionality is great. Current forecast works and 5 day forecast works as intended. Style overall looks good/better then the figma although there could be spacing in between the "feels like", "humidity" etc. Other than that job well done!
