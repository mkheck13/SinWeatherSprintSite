# 12/4/23 3:22pm Other then eval today I set up a very basic file structure. I am currently digging into the weather api docs on how to get the data I want.
# 12/5/23 3:37pm Worked on attempting to fetch data from API.
# 12/6/23 3:30pm Got all most of my fetches done. Working on five day and search bar next. Needs to add some styling.
# 12/7/23 3:38pm Added search functionality. Mild Styling to get objects to manipulate. Didn't get five day forecast done yet, will continue to work on after class.
# 12/8/23 3:35pm Got the five day to work. Started laying out the favorites, didn't get it done. Will finish the parts that didn't get done at a later point.
